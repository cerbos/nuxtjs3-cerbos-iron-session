# Cerbos, Nuxt.js and iron session Example

This example shows how to use [iron session](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session) with [Cerbos](https://cerbos.dev) in a [Nuxt.js 3](https://nuxt.com/).

The example features sign-in, guarded route and authenticated API to your Nuxt.js application which using Cerbos to authorize access.

## Overview

**[Cerbos](https://cerbos.dev)** is an open-source authorization-as-a-service option for allowing decoupled access control in your software. It allows writing human-readable policy definitions that serve as context-aware access control policies for your application resources.

Cerbos works with any identity provider services like Auth0, Okta, FusionAuth, Clerk, Magic, WorkOS or even your own, bespoke directory system.

Our [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) application uses iron-sesion behind the scene to provide a simple session mechanism to showcase the power of cerbos. The application is meant to showcase cerbos features like guarded route and permission based API endpoints.

The policies is defined in the `cerbos/policies` directory. Each policy is authored in the a very human-readable format which you can learn more about at the [Cerbos Policy documentation site](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/policies), and for the demo revolves around access to a `contacts` resource.

## How to Run the Example

### 1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cerbos/nuxtjs3-cerbos-iron-session
```

Then `cd` into the project directory and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

_Alternatviely you could use `yarn` or `pnpm` or anything that runs `npm scripts`_

### 2. Set up your iron-session

Iron session provides a simple mechanism to achieve stateless session. To simplify the use of this showcase the information required to define `iron-session` have been hardcoded within the [session.ts](src/server/utils/session.ts), but it is suggested to move this our into environment variables if you are planning to use this starter pack for production applications.

### 3. Run a Cerbos instance

Cerbos runs [along side of the app](https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/deployment/index.html). All Cerbos command included in this Showcase make use of a deployed sample cerbos app.
This instance is automatically by the showcase and it does not need any further setup.

The content of the Docker Container can be found in `./cerbos`. This folder includes all the information necessary to run a local copy of Cerbos. You should take a look at the content of the `policies` folder.

In the event in which you would like to run a local copy of Cerbos, you can easily do so using docker by following the steps below:

#### Use a local instance of Cerbos

1. Run a Local istance of Cerbos 

**If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed**: you can simply run the following command to start Cerbos in a Docker container:

```bash
cd ./cerbos
sh ./start.sh
```
2. Change the app to use query our local instance instead than the deployed version

To achieve this open `./utils/cerbos.js` and replace the existing code, with the suggested replacement in the comment. The end file should look something like this:

```javascript
import { GRPC } from "@cerbos/grpc";

export const cerbos = new GRPC(
  "localhost:3593",
  { tls: false }
);
```

3. Make changes to your Cerbos Policies

Your showcase is now running a local version of Cerbos, and you can easily make changes to the Policies and learn more about Cerbos and all its features.

### 4. Start the demo locally

To run your Nuxtjs application locally you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You could also `build` and `start` the app to see what it would be like in production. Deployment of this app is out of scope for this example.

### 5. Check out the example implementation

- Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see the included example code running.

There is a demonstration of changing the user's role, and seeing how that affects the permissions of the user to take actions on the resources.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server.
- `npm run build` - Builds the project for production.
- `npm run start` - Starts the production preview after build.
